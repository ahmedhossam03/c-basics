Singly Linked List project developed using C Language on Code::Blocks.

linked_list.h has the node declaration to data types or add more elements and it has the function prototypes
-make sure if you add elements to node that you add them in the functions prototypes in .h and .c

linked_list.c has the functions implementation any editing that happen in .h file must be added to the .c file as well so no errors occur.

main.c is the has the main function and any test cases to be added to the list.

WHEN CREATING A PROJECT MAKE SURE TO ADD ALL THREE FILE (linked_list.h / linked_list.c / main.c) IN THE PROJECT TO AVOID ERRORS.

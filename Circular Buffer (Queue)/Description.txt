Circular Buffer Project developed on Code::Blocks using C language

queue.h
- includes functions prototypes.
- edit "MAXSIZE" for buffer maximum size.
- change type of entry if you want to use different type.
- make sure any changes in queue.h should be changed accordingly in queue.c to avoid error.

queue.c
- includes functions implementations.
- any changes in queue.h should also be changed in queue.c

main.c
- it has some test cases you can add / change / remove to suit your project.

WHEN CREATING A PROJECT MAKE SURE TO ADD ALL THREE FILE (queue.h / queue.c / main.c) IN THE PROJECT TO AVOID ERRORS.

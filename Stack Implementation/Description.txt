Stack Data Structure Implementation developed on Code::Blocks using C language

stack.h
- includes functions prototypes.
- edit "MAXSIZE" for buffer maximum size.
- change type of entry if you want to use different type.
- make sure any changes in stack.h should be changed accordingly in stack.c to avoid errors

stack.c
- includes functions implementations.
- any changes in stack.h should also be changed in stack.c

main.c
- it has some test cases you can add / change / remove to suit your project.

WHEN CREATING A PROJECT MAKE SURE TO ADD ALL THREE FILES (stack.h / stack.c / main.c) IN THE PROJECT TO AVOID ERRORS.
